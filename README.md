## Introduction

To compile and run this program you need to have nodejs installed.

This was tested with node 5.5


On MacOS X the easiest way is to use homebrew.

```shell
brew install node
```


Install the required npm packages:

```shell
npm install
```


To compile the program:

```shell
npm run-script build
```

This creates a minified version ready for deployment.


To watch changes and recompile on demand while developing:

```shell
npm run-script watch
```
